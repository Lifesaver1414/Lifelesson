### Dont mess with giant-man-ox-lizard-whip monster

<body> So they called this guy Balrog. I'm with my mates when this guy jumps us. Me, being the one always starting fights, I told my hommies to go on. I can take him. After some argueing they went. I couldnt take him. I froze to death. So did he. The guy's made of fire yet lives in a mountain surrounded by snow. I wasn't the only one who didn't think things through.
